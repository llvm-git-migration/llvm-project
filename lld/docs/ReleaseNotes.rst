Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================

ELF Improvements
----------------

* Section ``CLASS`` syntax allows binding input section to named classes. This
  allows the linker to automatically pack the input sections into memory
  regions by automatically spilling to later class references if a region would
  overflow. This reduces the toil of manually packing regions (typical for
  embedded). It also makes full LTO feasible in such cases, since IR merging
  currently prevents the linker script from referring to input files.
