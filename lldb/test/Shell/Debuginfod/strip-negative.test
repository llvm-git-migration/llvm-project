# This is paranoia to make sure there's not a cached symbol file laying around

# RUN: mkdir -p %t/output

# Scenario 1
#  A simple stripped binary, no symbols (negative test: nothing's been cached, right?)

# RUN: yaml2obj %p/Inputs/bin-stripped.yaml -o %t/output/bin-stripped
# RUN: chmod a+x %t/output/bin-stripped

# Run a negative test (make sure we don't have symbols)

# RUN: %lldb -o "settings set symbols.enable-external-lookup false" \

# RUN:       -o "b func" \
# RUN:       -o "quit" \

# Should NOT have source file information:

# CHECK: Breakpoint 1: where = bin-stripped`func, address = 0x{{[0-9a-f]+}}
