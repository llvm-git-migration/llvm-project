Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the libc++ C++ Standard Library,
part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 19.0.0. Here we describe the
status of libc++ in some detail, including major improvements from the previous
release and new feature work. For the general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM releases may
be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about libc++, please see the `Libc++ Web Site
<https://libcxx.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the
main Libc++ web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please

What's New in Libc++ 20.0.0?
==============================

Implemented Papers
------------------

Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------

- The internal structure ``__compressed_pair`` has been replaced with ``[[no_unique_address]]``, resulting in reduced
  compile times and smaller debug information as well as better code gen if optimizations are disabled.

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- TODO: The ``LIBCXX_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`` CMake variable and the ``_LIBCPP_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS`` macro that were used to
  enable the safe mode will be removed in LLVM 20.

Upcoming Deprecations and Removals
----------------------------------

LLVM 21
~~~~~~~
TODO


ABI Affecting Changes
---------------------

- The internal structure ``__compressed_pair`` has been replaced with ``[[no_unique_address]]``. This change results in
  empty final types being placed at the beginning of the object instead of where the beginning of the
  ``__compressed_pair`` subobject was. This is only observable by checking the address of the subobject.

Build System Changes
--------------------

- The ``LIBCXX_EXECUTOR`` and ``LIBCXXABI_EXECUTOR`` CMake variables have been removed. Please
  set ``LIBCXX_TEST_PARAMS`` to ``executor=<...>`` instead.

- The Cmake variable ``LIBCXX_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY`` has been removed. The build system has been changed
  to automatically detect the presence of ``clang-tidy`` and the required ``Clang`` libraries.

- The CMake options ``LIBCXX_INSTALL_MODULES`` now defaults to ``ON``.
